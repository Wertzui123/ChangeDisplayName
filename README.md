# ChangeDisplayName
<b>This is a plugin to set your Nickname/change you're Display Name. And the best: It works if you have PurePerms too!</b>
- You can change your Display Name, so that you're name is different in chat, at the pause screen and so on.
- Teleporting however, only works with the real name.
<br>The .phar file can be found on <a href="https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/Wertzui123/ChangeDisplayName/ChangeDisplayName">poggit</a>.
<br><b>Have fun!</b>
